Description: Unicode to 8-bit charset transliteration codec.
        
        This package contains codecs for transliterating ISO 10646 texts into
        best-effort representations using smaller coded character sets (ASCII,
        ISO 8859, etc.).  The translation tables used by the codecs are from
        the ``transtab`` collection by Markus Kuhn.
        
        Three types of transliterating codecs are provided:
        
        "long", using as many characters as needed to make a natural
        replacement.  For example, \u00e4 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
        DIAERESIS ``ä`` will be replaced with ``ae``.
        
        "short", using the minimum number of characters to make a
        replacement.  For example, \u00e4 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
        DIAERESIS ``ä`` will be replaced with ``a``.
        
        "one", only performing single character replacements.  Characters
        that can not be transliterated with a single character are passed
        through unchanged. For example, \u2639 WHITE FROWNING FACE ``☹``
        will be passed through unchanged.
        
        Using the codecs is simple::
        
        >>> import translitcodec
        >>> u'fácil € ☺'.encode('translit/long')
        u'facil EUR :-)'
        >>> u'fácil € ☺'.encode('translit/short')
        u'facil E :-)'
        
        The codecs return Unicode by default.  To receive a bytestring back,
        either chain the output of encode() to another codec, or append the
        name of the desired byte encoding to the codec name::
        
        >>> u'fácil € ☺'.encode('translit/one').encode('ascii', 'replace')
        'facil E ?'
        >>> u'fácil € ☺'.encode('translit/one/ascii', 'replace')
        'facil E ?'
        
        The package also supplies a 'transliterate' codec, an alias for
        'translit/long'.

        =====================
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        Released on February 14, 2011
        
        - Fixes to the transtab table rebuilding tool.
        
        - Added translitcodec.__version__
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        Released on January 27, 2011
        
        - Resolves issue of "TypeError: character mapping must return integer,
        None or unicode" when a blank value (eg: \N{ZERO WIDTH SPACE} \u200B)
        was encoded.  Unicode blanks are now returned.
        
        - Characters in the ASCII range are no longer included in the translation
        tables.
